# The-Slithering-HD-Maps

This is a Foundry VTT Module made for people looking to run the official Paizo Adventure The Slithering with HD map assets instead of the default maps included in the pdf. This module does not include any other material for the adventure such as journals, creature entries, or other copyrighted content. This module is also limited to the maps already within the adventure, and maps that were not already present in the adventure (such as single-encounter maps) are not included.

Credits: PAIZO - Some of the maps uses trademarks and/or copyrights owned by Paizo Inc., used under Paizo's Community Use Policy. We are expressly prohibited from charging you to use or access this content. The maps are not published, endorsed, or specifically approved by Paizo.

Much of their content is available for free including map assets and top-down tokens. Find them here: https://www.forgotten-adventures.net/

Installation: Once the module is installed and activated, a compendium containing all the maps will appear. Simply import the maps from the compendium and you should be good to go.
